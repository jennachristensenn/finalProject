    "text": "The data that I will be working with is the Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset. This is a cleaned dataset of 253,680 responses to the CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a system of health-related telephone surveys. The data includes the response variable ‘Diabetes_binary’ indicating that a respondent either has diabetes or prediabetes [1], or does not have diabetes [0]. Twenty-one other variables are available that include both qualitative and quantitative variables. This data is commonly used to answer questions such as “which variables are accurate predictors of whether an individual has diabetes.” In addition to the response variable ‘Diabetes_binary’ I will be using the following predictor variables for my analysis:\n\nSmoker: Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your entire life [0 = no, 1 = yes]\nGenHlth: Would you say your general health is [1 = excellent, 2 = very good, 3 = good, 4 = fair, 5 = poor]\nSex: Gender [0 = female, 1 = male]\nAge: 13 level age category [1 = 18-24, 9 = 60-64, 13 = 80 and older]\nIncome: 8 level income scale [1 = &lt;10,000, 5 = &lt;35,000, 8 = &gt;75,000]\n\nThe goal of exploratory data analysis is to examine the underlying data. This is done by making sure each variable is assigned their appropriate category (dbl, char, factor), examining numeric summaries of the variables, and exploring different plots to visually inspect the data. Another aspect to check is missing values, as this can impact results calculated from the data. We want to make sure we have clean data so that our modeling can be as accurate as possible. For this project, our goal with modeling is to create an accurate representation of the data contained in the given set. We want to utilize the best possible model so that we can make predictions about future outcomes and identify underlying patterns. To achieve this, we train parameters and explore different types of models to get best representation of the data."
